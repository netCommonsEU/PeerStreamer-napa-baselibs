MONITORING LAYER TEST CODE
==========================

This is a simple test program to test (and show the usage of) the Monitoring Layer 
(and also the Messaging Layer).
The test suite consists of a single executable, mon_test.

The program runs either in active or passive mode.

In passive mode the program waits for any incoming connection and only sends replies ("pong"). 
In active mode, it sends "ping" messages to the peer specified.

Usage:
	./mon_test [-b <bindIp>] [-a <SocketId>] [-r <repository:port>] [-s <stunserver>]
Defaults:
	<bindIp> primary IP address of the host running mon_test. Autodetected if missing.
	<socketId> in active mode, send "ping"s to this peer
	<repository:port> address of repository server, default: repository.napa-wine.eu:9832
	<stunserver> STUN server address for NAT traversal. Default: stun.ekiga.net:3472

Measurements implemented:
 - hopcount
 - rtt

Measurement results are published to the repository, as well as the local peerID (socketId).

Example
=======


Host A is passive while Host B is active.

Host A (SocketIdA?: 192.168.85.88:9000-130.192.86.20:9000)

./MonTest

Host B (SocketIdB?: 192.168.85.133:9000-130.192.86.20:1651)

./MonTest -a 192.168.85.88:9000-130.192.86.20:9000
