/** @file neighborlist.h
 *
 * @brief Neighbor List API.
 *
 * The NeighborList maintains a repository-based list of PeerIDs. These PeerIDs are periodically updated via
 * repository queries. Tuning of these queries is done via the NeighborList manager's API.
 * The list of PeerIDs provided by the NeighborList might be used to initialize one Peer's trading neighborhood,
 * or to extend it with PeerIDs obtained from Repositories (i.e. not via gossiping or other non-centralized manner).
 * Several intances of NeighborList might be running at the same time in order to facilitate different
 * Active Peer data for different channels. 
 * Typically one NeighborList is created for each channel.
 *
 * A background NeighborList process takes care of communicating the Repositories, and updating the list.
 *
