This is an short explaination for the messaging layer library.   

The library requires the libevent library in the version 2.0.1 alpha and
the C math library. The library is implemented in C and works in
unix/linux. It is tested with Ubuntu 8.04.

The library can be compile with ./make.

This library is a network layer abstraction for p2p systems, that has
the primitives: 
	- connect to a peer 
	- send arbitrary size data to a peer

Furthermore, it provides the functionalites: 
	- pmtu discovery
	- NAT traversal
	- data fragmentation and reassembly

The library has six source code files: messagingLayer.h messagingLayer.c
transmissionHandler.h transmissionHandlder.c stun.h stun.c udpSocket.h
udpSocket.c 

The files stun.h stun.c udpSocket.h udpSocket.c are placed in the
subfolder "util". 

The messagingLayer.h and messagingLayer.c files contain the functions of
the API. These files are only wrapper files for function in the
transmissionHandler.h and transmissionHandler.c files. 

The files transmissionHandler.h and transmissionHandler.c have the main
functionality of the messaging layer. For simplicity several
functionalites were excluded into utility files stun.h, stun.c,
udpSocket.h ,and udpSocket.c .

Stun.h and stun.c contain the NAT traversal functionality according to
STUN. They are used by the transmissionHandler to implement a STUN
client.

The udpSocket.h and udpSocket.c files contain a udp socket abstraction.
In the current implementation the file works only with a unix socket.   

The tests folder contains various test programs and usage eexample code.
