/**
 * @file ml.h
 * @brief NAPA-WINE messaging layer API.
 * 
 * The messaging layer is a network layer abstraction for p2p systems, that has the primitives:
 *       - connect to a peer
 *       - send arbitrary size data to a peer
 *
 *  Furthermore, it provides the functionalites:
 *       - PMTU discovery
 *       - NAT traversal
 *       - data fragmentation and reassembly
 *
 * The messaging layer (ML) abstracts the access to transport 
 * (UDP/TCP) protocols and the corresponding service access points 
 * offered by the operating system by extending their capabilities 
 * and providing an overlay level addressing, i.e., assigning a 
 * unique identifier to each peer. 
 * 
 * For example, it provides the ability to send a chunk of
 * data to another peer, which has to be segmented and then
 * reassembled to fit into UDP segments. The messaging layer
 * also provides an interface to the monitoring module, which is
 * used for passive measurements: whenever a message is sent or
 * received an indication will be given to the monitoring module,
 * which then can update its statistics.
 * Another important feature of the messaging layer is mechanisms
 * for the traversal of NAT routers. Network Address Translation 
 * allows to attach several hosts to the Internet
 * using only one globally unique IP address. Therefore it is
 * very popular with private customers, who are also the main
 * target audience for P2P TV. However, the presence of a NAT
 * device may impede the ability to establish connections to other
 * peers, therefore, special NAT traversal functions are needed
 * in the messaging layer.
