We implemented a simple echo server to show how the messaging layer
library can be used. The echo server is named echoServer.c .

The echo server demonstartion requires that you start a STUN server
first. An open source STUN server is in the folder "../stun_server". It can
be started with the script start_stun_server.sh. In the following you
have to start three instances of the echo server in different shells,
each with a different argument. The arguments are 1, 2, and 3.

The commands for the demo in short:
    In the folder ../stun_server/stund/ start
    ./start_stun_server.sh
    Back in the original folder start
    ./echoServer 1
    ./echoServer 2
    ./echoServer 3
